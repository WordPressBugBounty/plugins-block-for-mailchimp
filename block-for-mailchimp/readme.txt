The plugin includes a dedicated Gutenberg block that lets you visually build and style your forms. You can display a form inline on a page, open it in a popup, or keep it floating at the top or bottom of the screen. Every form is responsive and adjusts automatically to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

All collected emails are safely stored in your Mailchimp audience. You can then use Mailchimp’s automation features to send newsletters, product updates, or event invitations. Whether you run a business, publish a blog, or manage a community, this plugin helps you stay connected with your audience.
